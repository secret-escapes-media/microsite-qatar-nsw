  content: If you’re itching to hit the beaches whilst you’re in Sydney, you won’t need to travel far. Bondi is possibly the most iconic in the country and just 8km from downtown. The surfing here is exquisite and the crescent sands lengthy; though it’s always guaranteed to be busy. Manly, on the other hand, is a little further from town and the beach is longer – fringed by Norfolk Island pines and every bit as pretty as Bondi.
